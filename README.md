<h2>stock-tracking</h2>
<p>A class named Product is defined. This class is used to store name, stock quantity, and price information for each product.

Another class named Stock is defined. This class allows adding and removing products and listing products in stock. This class is initialized with an empty list named products.

Two methods product_add() and product_remove() allow adding and removing products from the list. A method called stock_image() lists all items in stock.

The main code block creates an instance of the Stock class and starts a while loop. The user can choose to add items, remove items from stock, view current stocks or exit the program.

To exit the program, product_add(), product_remove(), stock_view() or the relevant method is called according to the user's preference. If the user makes an invalid selection, an error message is displayed.
